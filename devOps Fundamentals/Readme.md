## What is DevOps

DevOps is a software development practice that promotes collaboration between development and operations, resulting in faster and more reliable software delivery.  
Commonly referred to as a culture, DevOps connects people, process, and technology to deliver continuous value.

## Principles of DevOps

1. Collaboration  
   The key premise behind DevOps is collaboration. Development and operations teams coalesce into a functional team that communicates, shares feedback, and collaborates throughout the entire development and deployment cycle. Often, this means development and operations teams merge into a single team that works across the entire application lifecycle.
2. Automation  
   An essential practice of DevOps is to automate as much of the software development lifecycle as possible. This gives developers more time to write code and develop new features. Automation is a key element of a CI/CD pipeline and helps to reduce human errors and increase team productivity. With automated processes, teams achieve continuous improvement with short iteration times, which allows them to quickly respond to customer feedback.
3. Continuous Improvement  
   Continuous improvement was established as a staple of agile practices, as well as lean manufacturing and Improvement Kata. It’s the practice of focusing on experimentation, minimizing waste, and optimizing for speed, cost, and ease of delivery. Continuous improvement is also tied to continuous delivery, allowing DevOps teams to continuously push updates that improve the efficiency of software systems. The constant pipeline of new releases means teams consistently push code changes that eliminate waste, improve development efficiency, and bring more customer value.
4. Customer-centric action  
   DevOps teams use short feedback loops with customers and end users to develop products and services centered around user needs. DevOps practices enable rapid collection and response to user feedback through use of real-time live monitoring and rapid deployment. Teams get immediate visibility into how live users interact with a software system and use that insight to develop further improvements.

5. Create with the end in mind  
   This principle involves understanding the needs of customers and creating products or services that solve real problems. Teams shouldn’t ‘build in a bubble’, or create software based on assumptions about how consumers will use the software. Rather, DevOps teams should have a holistic understanding of the product, from creation to implementation.

## Why Devops is needed

The software development process can be a highly manual process, resulting in a significant number of code errors.  
Development and operations teams can often be out of sync, which can slow software delivery and disappoint business stakeholders.  
 DevOps creates efficiency across all tasks involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software.
Connecting development and operations leads to increased visibility, more accurate requirements, improved communication, and faster time to market.

## What makes devops different from other software development practices

DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations, creating significant efficiencies across the development and deployment of software. DevOps includes a strong emphasis on automation, helping reduce the overall number of errors.

## What is Philosophy of DevOps

The philosophy of DevOps is to take end-to-end responsibility across all aspects of the project. Unlike more traditional methods of developing software, DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations teams—something that is often missing and can heavily impede the process of software delivery.

Providing a comprehensive framework to develop and release software, DevOps connects development and operations teams—a gap that can create challenges and inefficiencies in software delivery.

## How do devops and agile relate to one another

Although both DevOps and agile are software development practices, they each have a slightly different focus. DevOps is a culture that focuses on creating efficiency for all stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software.  
 Agile is a lean manufacturing process that helps provide a software development production framework.  
Agile is often specific to the development team, where the scope of DevOps extends to all stakeholders involved in the production and maintenance of software. DevOps and agile can be used together to create a highly efficient software development environment.

## Agile Methodologies and planning

Commonly used in software teams, agile development is a delivery approach that relates to lean manufacturing. The development is completed in short, incremental sprints. Although it is different than DevOps, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive—agile practices and tools can help drive efficiencies within the development team, contributing to the overall DevOps culture.

## Version control

With a team working together, version control is a crucial part of accurate, efficient software development. A version control system—such as Git—takes a snapshot of your files, letting you permanently go back to any version at any time. With a version control system, you can be confident you won’t run into conflicts with the changes you’re working on.

## CI/CD

Continuous integration is the process of automating builds and testing that occur as the code is completed and committed to the system.  
 Once the code is committed, it follows an automated process that provides validation—and then commits only tested and validated code into the main source code, which is often referred to as the master branch, main, or trunk.  
 Continuous integration automates this process, which leads to significant efficiencies. Any bugs are identified early on, prior to merging any code with the master branch.
Continuous delivery is the fundamental practice that occurs within DevOps enabling the delivery of fast, reliable software.  
 While the process is similar to the overarching concept of DevOps, continuous delivery is the framework where every component of code is tested, validated, and committed as they are completed, resulting in the ability to deliver software at any time. Continuous integration is a process that is a component of continuous delivery.
