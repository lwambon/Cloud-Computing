## What is Virtualization In Cloud Computing?

Virtualization is the software technology that helps in providing the logical isolation of physical resources.  
Creating logical isolation of physical resources such as RAM, CPU, and Storage.. over the cloud is known as Virtualization in Cloud Computing.  
In simple we can say creating types of Virtual Instances of computing resources over the cloud.  
It provides better management and utilization of hardware resources with logical isolation making the applications independent of others.  
 It facilitates streamlining the resource allocation and enhancing scalability for multiple virtual computers within a single physical source offering cost-effectiveness and better optimization of resources.

## Architecture Of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and sub-components required for cloud computing. These components typically refer to:

Front end ( Fat client, Thin client)
Back-end platforms ( Servers, Storage )
Cloud-based delivery and a network ( Internet, Intranet, Intercloud )

### Front End ( User Interaction Enhancement )

The User Interface of Cloud Computing consists of 2 sections of clients. The Thin clients are the ones that use web browsers facilitating portable and lightweight accessibilities and others are known as Fat Clients that use many functionalities for offering a strong user experience.

### Back-end Platforms ( Cloud Computing Engine )

The core of cloud computing is made at back-end platforms with several servers for storage and processing computing. Management of Applications logic is managed through servers and effective data handling is provided by storage. The combination of these platforms at the backend offers the processing power, and capacity to manage and store data behind the cloud.

### Cloud-Based Delivery and Network

On-demand access to the computer and resources is provided over the Internet, Intranet, and Intercloud. The Internet comes with global accessibility, the Intranet helps in internal communications of the services within the organization and the Intercloud enables interoperability across various cloud services. This dynamic network connectivity ensures an essential component of cloud computing architecture on guaranteeing easy access and data transfer.

## Cloud Security

Cloud security recommended to measures and practices designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud computing environments. The following are some of the best practices of cloud security:

Data Encryption: Encryption is essential for securing data stored in the cloud. It ensures that data remains unreadable to unauthorized users even if it is intercepted.  
Access Control: Implementing strict access controls and authentication mechanisms helps ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and resources in the cloud.  
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as passwords, biometrics, or security tokens, before gaining access to cloud services.
