## What Is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing means storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computer’s hard drive or local server.   
Cloud computing is also referred to as Internet-based computing, it is a technology where the resource is provided as a service through the Internet to the user.   
The data that is stored can be files, images, documents, or any other storable document.  

## Operations that can be performed with Cloud Computing
Storage, backup, and recovery of data  
Delivery of software on demand  
Development of new applications and services  
Streaming videos and audio  

## Understanding How Cloud Computing Works?
Infrastructure: Cloud computing depends on remote network servers hosted on internet for store, manage, and process the data.  

On-Demand Acess: Users can access cloud services and resources based on-demand they can scale up or down the without having to invest for physical hardware.  

Types of Services: Cloud computing offers various benefits such as cost saving, scalability, reliability and acessibility it reduces capital expenditures, improves efficiency.

## Origins Of Cloud Computing
Mainframe computing in the 1950s and the internet explosion in the 1990s came together to give rise to cloud computing. Since businesses like Amazon, Google, and Salesforce started providing web-based services in the early 2000s. The term “cloud computing” has gained popularity. Scalability, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness are to be facilitated by the concept’s on-demand internet-based access to computational resources.

These days, cloud computing is pervasive, driving a wide range of services across markets and transforming the processing, storage, and retrieval of data

## What Are The Types of Cloud Computing Services?
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  
Platform as a Service (PaaS)  
Software as a Service (SaaS)  
Function as as Service (FaaS) 

### Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS )
Flexibility and Control: IaaS comes up with providing virtualized computing resources such as VMs, Storage, and networks facilitating users with control over the Operating system and applications.  

Reducing Expenses of Hardware: IaaS provides business cost savings with the elimination of physical infrastructure investments making it cost-effective.  

Scalability of Resources: The cloud provides in scaling of hardware resources up or down as per demand facilitating optimal performance with cost efficiency.  

### Platform as a Service ( PaaS )
Simplifying the Development: Platform as a Service offers application development by keeping the underlying Infrastructure as an Abstraction. It helps the developers to completely focus on application logic ( Code ) and background operations are completely managed by the AWS platform.  

Enhancing Efficiency and Productivity: PaaS lowers the Management of Infrastructure complexity, speeding up the Execution time and bringing the updates quickly to market by streamlining the development process.  

Automation of Scaling: Management of resource scaling, guaranteeing the program’s workload efficiency is ensured by PaaS.  

### SaaS (software as a service)
Collaboration And Accessibility: Software as a Service (SaaS) helps users to easily access applications without having the requirement of local installations. It is fully managed by the AWS Software working as a service over the internet encouraging effortless cooperation and ease of access.  

Automation of Updates: SaaS providers manage the handling of software maintenance with automatic latest updates ensuring users gain experience with the latest features and security patches.  

Cost Efficiency: SaaS acts as a cost-effective solution by reducing the overhead of IT support by eliminating the need for individual software licenses.  

### Function as a Service (FaaS)
Event-Driven Execution: FaaS helps in the maintenance of servers and infrastructure making users worry about it. FaaS facilitates the developers to run code as a response to the events.  

Cost Efficiency: FaaS facilitates cost efficiency by coming up with the principle “Pay as per you Run” for the computing resources used.  

Scalability and Agility: Serverless Architectures scale effortlessly in handing the workloads promoting agility in development and deployment.

## What Are Cloud Deployment Models?
The following are the Cloud Deployment Models:

### Private Deployment Model
It provides an enhancement in protection and customization by cloud resource utilization as per particular specified requirements. It is perfect for companies which looking for security and compliance needs.  

###  Public Deployment Model
It comes with offering a pay-as-you-go principle for scalability and accessibility of cloud resources for numerous users. it ensures cost-effectiveness by providing enterprise-needed services.  

###  Hybrid Deployment Model
It comes up with a combination of elements of both private and public clouds providing seamless data and application processing in between environments. It offers flexibility in optimizing resources such as sensitive data in private clouds and important scalable applications in the public cloud.

## Characteristics Of Cloud Computing
The following are the characterisitics of Cloud Computing:

Scalability: With Cloud hosting, it is easy to grow and shrink the number and size of servers based on the need. This is done by either increasing or decreasing the resources in the cloud.   

Save Money: An advantage of cloud computing is the reduction in hardware costs. Instead of purchasing in-house equipment, hardware needs are left to the vendor.  

Reliability: If one server goes offline it will have no effect on availability, as the virtual servers will continue to pull resources from the remaining network of servers.  

Physical Security: The underlying physical servers are still housed within data centers and so benefit from the security measures that those facilities implement to prevent people from accessing or disrupting them on-site.  

Outsource Management: When you are managing the business, Someone else manages your computing infrastructure. 
## Top Reasons to Switch from On-premise to Cloud Computing
The following are the Top reasons to switch from on-premise to cloud computing:

Reduces cost: The cost-cutting ability of businesses that utilize cloud computing over time is one of the main advantages of this technology.By the use of cloud servers businesses will save and reduce costs with no need to employ a staff of technical support personnel to address server issues. 

More storage: For software and applications to execute as quickly and efficiently as possible, it provides more servers, storage space, and computing power. Many tools are available for cloud storage such as Dropbox, Onedrive, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, etc.  

Employees Better Work Life Balance: Direct connections between cloud computing benefits, and the work and personal lives of an enterprise’s workers can both improve because of cloud computing. 

## Top leading Cloud Computing companies
1. Amazon Web Services(AWS)

 One of the most successful cloud-based businesses is Amazon Web Services(AWS), which is an Infrastructure as a Service(Iaas) offering that pays rent for virtual computers on Amazon’s infrastructure.

2. Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform

Microsoft is creating the Azure platform which enables the .NET Framework Application to run over the internet as an alternative platform for Microsoft developers. This is the classic Platform as a Service(PaaS).

3. Google Cloud Platform ( GCP )

 Google has built a worldwide network of data centers to service its search engine. From this service, Google has captured the world’s advertising revenue. By using that revenue, Google offers free software to users based on infrastructure. This is called Software as a Service(SaaS).  

## Advantages of Cloud Computing
Cost Efficiency: Cloud Computing provides flexible pricing to the users with the principal pay-as-you-go model. It helps in lessening capital expenditures of Infrastructure, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses companies.  

Flexibility and Scalability: Cloud services facilitate the scaling of resources based on demand. It ensures the efficiency of businesses in handling various workloads without the need for large amounts of investments in hardware during the periods of low demand.
